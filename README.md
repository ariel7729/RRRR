(B) Financial data: equity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, .... Different formats
  (a) cross-sectional data: collected by observing many subjects (such as individual- s, firms, countries, or regions) at the same point of time, or without regard to differences in time.
  (b) time series data: a sequence of observations of a subject, e.g., equity prices, taken over time.
  (c) Panel data: multi-dimensional data involving measurements over time. For ex- ample, we consider the time series of a number of stocks over a period of time. Usually, it is a big matrix, each column is a time series, each row is a cross-sectional observation.
